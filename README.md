# Predicting-Fatalities-in-Southeast-Asia-using-LSTM-A-Geopolitical-Analysis

We have analyzed a dataset of security events in Southeast Asia, with a focus on identifying patterns in the occurrence of events and the type of events that result in fatalities. We first explored the dataset using basic descriptive statistics and visualizations to gain a better understanding of the distribution of events across different countries and time periods.
The LSTM project focused on predicting the number of fatalities in Southeast Asian countries based on event date. The project utilized a deep learning model called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze patterns and trends in the data.

The project showed promising results, with the LSTM model accurately predicting the number of fatalities for many events in the dataset. The model can help governments and organizations prepare for potential security threats and take appropriate measures to prevent fatalities.


We then conducted further analysis by focusing on events that targeted civilians and analyzing the type of events that resulted in fatalities. We used Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries like pandas and matplotlib to perform this analysis and visualize the results.

The insights gained from this analysis can be useful for geopolitical researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders interested in understanding the security situation in Southeast Asia and identifying potential threats to stability and security in the region. Overall, this page provides a practical example of how data analysis and visualization can be used to gain insights into complex and important real-world issues.
